An HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based basic weather application is represented by this code. Below is an overview of each section: 

#Structure of HTML:
Head Section: External stylesheet links, such as those to a custom stylesheet (style.css), Google Fonts, and Font Awesome icons.
"Weather APP" is the page's current title.

JavaScript: API Interaction:
Retrieves weather information for a given city by using the OpenWeatherMap API.
To authenticate the requests, an API key, or apikey, is given in the request URL.
The weather data presented in the HTML is updated by the checkweather function, which retrieves data for a certain city.

Functions:
checkweather (cityname): Retrieves weather information and refreshes the user interface with information on temperature, wind speed, humidity, and humidity level.
cityname(): handles the input for the city name, passing the value as an input to check the weather or returning "Bengaluru" in the absence of any input.

Event Listener:
To access the cityname () function, an event listener for clicks is appended to the search button.

Summary: 
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, this application retrieves and presents weather data for a specified city. 
To examine the current weather, users can input the name of the city and click the search button. 
The weather information includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and type (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain). 
After the data is retrieved, the user interface refreshes with pertinent icons and conceals the loading GIF.
